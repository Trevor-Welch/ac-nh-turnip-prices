# Turnip Prophet (2020)

This is my fork of [Turnip Prophet](https://github.com/mikebryant/ac-nh-turnip-prices), an open-source price calculator for a video game's in-game stock market.

Turnip Prophet is a single-page web application that predicts future "stalk market" prices in Animal Crossing: New Horizons based on the game's data provided. The player purchases Turnips at the beginning of the week and every day, the price changes. Using the player's data, the calculator tries to predict the prices for the rest of the week to determine the best time to sell the Turnips to make the most in-game money - leading to massive profits.

This project used raw HTML, CSS, and JS.

## My Contribution To The Project

I contributed over 1,000 lines of code to this project, adding things like:
- 400+ lines of CSS taking the app from a black/white raw HTML project to something with UI similar to the video game
- Worked with the back-end team to update the form inputs so the API was passing the right data
- Added some info about the project
